# Computer-Algebra
Implementations of some important computer algebra algorithms in C++ (\*.cpp) and Pari/GP (\*.gp)

# Description
* fft.cpp: Fast Fourier Transform (and Polynomial Multiplication)  
* gcd.cpp: Extended Euclidean GCD Algorithm (and finding Mulitplicative Inverses)   
* mm.cpp: Strassen Matrix Multiplication  
* ss.cpp: Primality Testing Algorithms (Solovay-Strassen, Miller-Rabin), (and Jacobi symbol calculation, fast checking whether a number is a perfect power, Repeated Squaring Exponentiation)  
* aks.gp: Implementation of AKS primality test  
* fct.gp: Subroutines employed while factorizing polynomials over finite fields, (Distinct Degree Factorization, Equal Degree factorization, Computing Squarefree part, taking p^{th} root (when it exists) of a polynomial in a finite field with characteristic p, using Frobenius action)  
* irred.gp: Check whether a polynomial is irreducible over a finite field.
